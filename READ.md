#Pristine Marketplace: a marketplace to turn that forgotten device into cash.

This project is my first attempt at a full stack web application using the M.E.N. Stack (Angular was not yet covered).

Inspiration behind developing the Pristine Marketplace:

Chances are you or someone you know has a smart phone (iPhone, Samsung, etc.) that
is not longer being used and is collecting dust somewhere. The Pristine Marketplace
allows users to list their device to a local market; meaning customers are located
in and around the area.

Buyers are able to:
- Create listings
- View both their own and the whole inventory of phones.
- Update their listings.
- Delete their own listings.

Sellers are able to:
- View all listings
- Filter the listings via a Search feature.
- Inquire further about any listing that interests them.


Authentication and Authorization is enforced by a local strategy to provide for
a safe and vetted marketplace.

Technologies Used: MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and DOM Manipulation.

Notable NPM Packages: mongoose-regex-search.

Will come back to refactor:
HTML / CSS

Will Implement:
Stripe API

Known Bug: "file undefined" error when edit is submitted without entering
